## Dockerfile
<br />

In our projects we use [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/build/) to publish our website and the first thing we need to get it right is Dockerfile.

This is a pre-file, a set of instructions which are needed to write the image. It describes what should be there in the image and what commands, dependencies, and processes it will contain. 

When you run the docker run command, the program first checks if the required image is in the local storage.

### Build

```bash
docker build -t picachu-ui .
```

### Run
```bash
docker run --detach --publish 7551:80 --rm --name picachu-ui --env ENV_KEY="'dev'" --env API_ROOT="'http://localhost:7501/api'" picachu-ui
```
